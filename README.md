## User analysis: 

One of the first steps is to create some personas. This will let us differentiate different types of the user of the application.

She is really enthusiastic with working with us as it will be the first time, she will have an online presence. She wants us to design a website for potential clients that will make her business grow.

 

## Task analysis: 
The main goal is to make an application that will let users pick theme for their websites that will generate more traffic to the website that they own. 
Another goal is for the user to test out live clients before purchase to make sure that the users of the website are happy with it.
Another is to purchase the desired design that is selected so they can start using it for their website. 

Using Hierarchical Task Analysis, we can further break down the task into sub-task:
In order to generate more traffic to the website
The user has to decide the user interest
Add a UI theme to test out with users
If users like it than buy the theme otherwise repeat the process
Confirm the order



## Domain analysis: 

This is how a user can interact with the DesginBOT system.
