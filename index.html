<h2 id="useranalysis">User analysis:</h2>

<p>One of the first steps is to create some personas. This will let us differentiate different types of the user of the application. </p>

<p>1.Pulkit Patel</p>

<p>Age: 26
Occupation: Works at a branding company</p>

<p>Bio: Pulkit is a young employee at a small company. He is close to the owner and his owner want a redesign of the website that they currently own. He is motivated to work with us and have the website stand out with improvements on the User interface. </p>

<ol>
<li>Prateek Patel</li>
</ol>

<p>Age: 30
Occupation: Owns a business</p>

<p>Bio: Pratik owns a business that has quite a good foot traffic but is really lacking in the online presence as he doesnâ€™t have a website. He asked me to design a website that looks good and when his business address is entered in a search engine it shows that website.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rajeshri Patel </li>
</ol>

<p>Age: 45
Occupation: Owns a side business that focuses on services </p>

<p>Bio: Rajeshri owns a franchise but in her spare time she likes to help people with legal services. She is really enthusiastic with working with us as it will be the first time, she will have an online presence. She wants us to design a website for potential clients that will make her business grow.</p>

<h2 id="taskanalysis">Task analysis:</h2>

<p>The main goal is to make an application that will let users pick theme for their websites that will generate more traffic to the website that they own. 
Another goal is for the user to test out live clients before purchase to make sure that the users of the website are happy with it.
Another is to purchase the desired design that is selected so they can start using it for their website. </p>

<p>Using Hierarchical Task Analysis, we can further break down the task into sub-task:
In order to generate more traffic to the website
The user has to decide the user interest
Add a UI theme to test out with users
If users like it than buy the theme otherwise repeat the process
Confirm the order</p>

<h2 id="domainanalysis">Domain analysis:</h2>

<p>This is how a user can interact with the DesginBOT system. </p>

<h2 id="sketches">Sketches</h2>

<p>This are the initial sketches that I came up during like a brainstorming session</p>

<p>This are the resketches after selecting 3 that looked good and was relevant. This was chosen because the login screen is simple to use for a user and the user can create an account on the same screen. They also can be on the same page to also retrieve there username or password if they have forgotten. </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/Krushan1/User-Interaction-Project/blob/master/sketch5.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This theme picker screen has an advantage because the user can interact in such a way that make the work of the user quick with having to remember to less. </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/Krushan1/User-Interaction-Project/blob/master/sketch6.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The featured themes screen shows all the featured themes that gets generated when the user logs in. They can choose to select this and move on with editing the theme that they have chosen and gives user the flexibility to change the screen however they like.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/Krushan1/User-Interaction-Project/blob/master/sketch7.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This screen lets the user purchase the theme that they have selected and edited using the screens. The screen will be informative as it will clearly show the details on what they will be buying and an option to pay. When they click pay, payment option shows up with the pay summary and the payment type that they desire to pay with. And the last screen will let the user enter details like Name on card, Card Number and Expiry date.</p>
